An interactive physics simulator that visualizes linear momentum, collisions, and conservation laws. Ideal for exploring how mass and velocity affect outcomes in elastic and inelastic collisions.

Features
- Adjustable mass and initial velocity for two objects
- Simulates both elastic and perfectly inelastic collisions
- Real-time momentum and kinetic energy statistics
- Vector visualization for velocity and momentum
- Toggle for slow-motion and real-time modes

How to Use
- Use sliders to set mass and velocity of each object
- Choose the collision type (elastic or inelastic)
- Press space to simulate, and observe the motion and resulting values
- Analyze the conservation of momentum and energy
